 Future plans/patch notes 
############################

- Currently only allows a single type of polyhedral in a given pool; I can probably use "for" loops to do this
- Do not yet have a means of defining non-numeric dice (EoE)
- No logging function yet
- Make rolling repeatedly easier than it currently is; this can probably be done using "while" loops around the current rollers
