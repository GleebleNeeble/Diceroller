# Diceroller
To run the Diceroller application on MacOS or Windows you can download the executables from the top directory.

On a Mac you'll need to allow the file to run via the Privacy/Security menu in System Preferences when you first download it.

For other OS's the .py files need to be kept in the same directory and running ./Diceroller.py from there will take you to the main menu.
