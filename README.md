# Diceroller
To run the Diceroller application on MacOS or Windows you can download the executables from the top directory.

On a Mac you'll need to allow the file to run via the Privacy/Security menu in System Preferences when you first download it. On first time set up your best bet is to run the file from the terminal (you may need to run 'chmod +x <path to RPGDiceRoller>' for it to run). Once you've done this once you should be able to run the roller with just a double-click of the file's icon. I'm working on turning this into an actual app.

For other OS's download the .py files in src and run the RPGDiceRoller file using python3.
